# Prime Tier 2

Repository for all Prime Academy Tier 2 Work

Description of what tier 2 is like:

DEVELOPING YOUR SKILLS
As you begin your in-person classroom experience, you’ll dive headfirst into fundamental software engineering concepts. You’ll learn from instructors, mentors and each other as you apply concepts from lectures in hands-on challenges. Each day is a unique adventure, but here’s what a typical day during Tier 2 might look like:

8:00 AM Morning Ramp-Up: Grab some coffee and get answers to questions that might be plaguing you from yesterday's challenge.
8:30 AM Job Skills: Jumping into code first thing in the morning can be tricky for the most seasoned developers. We start the morning with a talk focused on job-seeking, networking or communication skills.
9:00 AM Morning Concept: Your instructor introduces the morning’s key concept with a lecture. Instruction is highly interactive relying heavily on class participation, impromptu Q+A, and plenty of live coding.
10:00 AM Pair Challenge: You’ll tackle the morning's assignment paired with one of your classmates. Working together with new classmates regularly you’ll apply the concepts you’ve just learned to a code challenge.
12:00 PM Lunch: Need an hour to process? Chat with your peers and students from the other cohorts over a board game while you rest and refuel.
1:00 PM Afternoon Concept: Afternoon concepts raise the complexity bar, requiring more hands-on instruction, practice and patience - but don’t worry, your instructor will break it down with you.
3:00 PM Evening Challenge: Cap off the day with a coding challenge covering what you’ve learned today. We talk through the problem as a group before breaking to conquer the task at hand.
