Testing File Example: 



Function: Sum
take some input 2 numbers
return back the 2 numbers added together

Test with: 
sum(2, 3) expect it to give us 5
sum(2, -2) expect it to give -1
sum('2', '3') expect it to give us 5
sum(2.5, -1) expect 1.5
sum('foo', 'bar') expect it to give NaN
sum(3) expect it to treat the other as 0 and give 3
sum(2, 3, 5) expect to ignore anything extra, add two only
sum(true, false) expect it to give NaN
sum(5/4, 67) -same test case as sum(2, 3)
let num1 = something, num2 = something
also are the same as above but depends on what num1 is & num2 is

Testing function runs to see if it works
